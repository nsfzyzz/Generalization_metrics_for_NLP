        This module already exists in PyTorch. The reason I implemented it here from scratch is that
        PyTorch implementation is super complicated as they made it as generic/robust as possible whereas
        on the other hand I only want to support a limited use-case.

        Also this is arguable the most important architectural component in the Transformer model.

        Additional note:
        This is conceptually super easy stuff. It's just that matrix implementation makes things a bit less intuitive.
        If you take your time and go through the code and figure out all of the dimensions + write stuff down on paper
        you'll understand everything. Also do check out this amazing blog for conceptual understanding:

        https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/

        Optimization notes:

        qkv_nets could be replaced by Parameter(torch.empty(3 * model_dimension, model_dimension)) and one more matrix
        for bias, which would make the implementation a bit more optimized. For the sake of easier understanding though,
        I'm doing it like this - using 3 "feed forward nets" (without activation/identity hence the quotation marks).
        Conceptually both implementations are the same.

        PyTorch's query/key/value are of different shape namely (max token sequence length, batch size, model dimension)
        whereas I'm using (batch size, max token sequence length, model dimension) because it's easier to understand
        and consistent with computer vision apps (batch dimension is always first followed by the number of channels (C)
        and image's spatial dimensions height (H) and width (W) -> (B, C, H, W).

        This has an important optimization implication, they can reshape their matrix into (B*NH, S/T, HD)
        (where B - batch size, S/T - max src/trg sequence length, NH - number of heads, HD - head dimension)
        in a single step and I can only get to (B, NH, S/T, HD) in single step
        (I could call contiguous() followed by view but that's expensive as it would incur additional matrix copy)
